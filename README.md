# The problem Rakt Daan solves
The current blood management system in India is facing critical challenges including shortage of quality blood, inefficiencies in the supply chain, lack of transparency, and wastage due to poor storage and management practices. The presence of fraudulent organizations further exacerbates the situation, making it difficult for those in need of blood transfusions to access reliable and safe blood. This has resulted in a need for an innovative and efficient blood management system to address these issues and improve the overall availability and quality of blood, increase transparency and accountability, and provide reassurance to blood donors.
